Sample Predictions – SIGN2SOUND Phase 2 Demo

Sample 1 (sample_1.png)
-----------------------
True Sign       : Z
Predicted Sign  : Z
Status          : Sign Stable (after temporal smoothing)
Result          : Correct

Description:
The user performs the sign for the letter 'Z'. The system initially shows
live predictions and confirms the final output once the prediction becomes
stable after temporal smoothing.


Sample 2 (sample_2.png)
-----------------------
True Sign       : Y
Predicted Sign  : Y
Status          : Sign Stable (after temporal smoothing)
Result          : Correct

Description:
The user performs the sign for the letter 'Y'. During live inference, the
model briefly fluctuates between nearby classes before converging to the
correct sign using prediction smoothing.
